# Personalized Learning and Assessment

This project provides a platform for personalized learning and assessment for students. It includes structured learning materials and assessments, as well as TensorFlow.js integration for machine learning tasks and also this is a fullstack project for a personalized learning and assessment tool, designed to provide support to students using AI-powered features. It allows students to enter their information, complete an assessment, and receive personalized feedback.

## Features

- **Learning Structure:** Provides a structured view of the learning material with sections for different lessons covering various topics.
- **Assessment:** Allows students to test their understanding through quizzes and tests.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes TensorFlow.js for machine learning tasks such as model creation and training.
